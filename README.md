## Overview

The **Planschrift Project** is a sub-project of the **Planiverse Font Family**, based on **Hwe Mincho**, aiming to supplement CJK Unified Ideographs Extension Areas using traditional (old-style) glyph forms as the standard.

## Coverage

This font aims to support all characters from **Extension B through Extension J** of the CJK Unified Ideographs. However, **Extension J is currently missing**, and other areas are only partially covered.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This font has **not yet been fully developed**. Missing characters were auto-generated using the **zi2zi** model, but have not been manually refined.

## License

This font follows the same license as the original font and is released under the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/). See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for full details.

Unofficial Chinese translation of the license: https://www.maoken.com/ofl

License summary:

> **■ Hwe Mincho Font License Statement**
>
> - This font can be used freely for print, display, and embedding in digital documents and devices.
> - It can be redistributed freely.
> - It may be included in larger software packages for sale (but cannot be sold as a standalone product).
> - It can be modified to create new fonts.

### You may:

- Use the font **commercially or non-commercially**, for free, with no need to notify the author or cite sources.
- Re-distribute, install, or embed the font into any software or device.
- Modify, expand, or convert the font format. However:
  - **Do not use the reserved names “Planschrift” or “遍玨”** for modified versions.
  - Modified versions must still be released under the **same license**.
  - Format conversion **without any other modification** may continue using the reserved names.

### You may not:

- Sell or resell the font, either standalone or bundled with other fonts.

- This font contains **no political content or intent**, and the author assumes no legal responsibility for how it is used.

## FAQ

### 1. Why are there two font files?

- Because a single font file can only store up to **65,535 glyphs**, which is less than the total number of ideographs.

### 2. Why doesn’t this font support **Complex Text Layout (CTL)** or **Ideographic Variation Selectors (IVS)**?

- This font is intended as a **tool font** (for display only, not typesetting), like [Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont) or [Noto Unicode](https://github.com/MY1L/Unicode/tree/main/NotoUnicode).
- Complex typesetting or alternate glyphs for regional forms **are not within scope**. If you need such features, you’re encouraged to make a derivative font yourself.
